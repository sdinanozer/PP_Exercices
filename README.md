# Python Playground Exercices
Some projects that I used as python exercice from the book Python Playground by Mahesh Venkitachalam

I slightly changed some projects by modifying existing files or by adding new files.
Feel free to use files created by me but original files have MIT license.

You can find the repository with original files [here](https://github.com/electronut/pp)
